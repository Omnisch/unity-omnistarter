# Omnistarter Unity Toolkit

OUT for short, is a Unity 2022.3.16f1 toolkit, including

- handy scripts, e.g. simple logics, input, file IO, utilities
- editor tweakers, e.g. auto updating modified date in scripts
- useful image shaders
- etc.

It was made by myself and for myself, so it may be difficult to use for others.
